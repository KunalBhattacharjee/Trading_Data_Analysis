This folder contains all the code and the CSVs prepared to do all the analysis. All the code is in Python.
I've added both .py and .ipynb types depending on where you run it. The python files contain all the analysis and inferences I performed.
I wanted to create a nice Dashboard with beautiful visuals on Qlik or Tableau but would've needed a bit more time for that.
The files are as explained below :-
The Fill-Combined csv is the output file created from the 2 JumpTradingInterview-Fills.*.csv files. 
The Fill-Predicted csv is similar as above with the exception that the Price column has been predicted using Machine Learning. This and 
the above CSVs were created using the Fills code file. This also contains rest of the analysis.
The MD-Combined is the output file created from the 2 JumpTradingInterview-MarketData-ASCII.*.txt files. Relevant code file is the Market_Data_Prep.
Lastly, apologies for any typo or grammatical mistakes if there!
